# X-TOKEN
X-Token is the first token that will empower crypto traders, investors, and minorities who have no access to computers. Building decentralized BI applications and donating the usage fees will help cryptomaniacs and minorities alike.

Decentralized crypto currencies got created to give people more freedom and more control over their assets. But at the same time itâ€™s locking out a lot of minorities who canâ€™t even afford a computer nor internet access. All of the fees earned by our dApps (decentralized Applications) will be used to empower minorities and educate them to not be left out in the digital world.

# Automatic Liquidity Pool
X-TOKEN employs an automatic liquidity pool algorithm (AutoLP) in its token contract. As mentioned above, the network collects 5% from each transaction, whether the order is a buy or sell and adds it to the LP. This also acts as an arbitrage resistant mechanism that secures a portion of the volume of X-TOKEN as a reward for the holders. The intended goal is to minimize price movements when large wallets decide to sell their tokens in the future, which when compared to coins without an AutoLP system, leads to a reduction in significant price fluctuations.

# Security of X-TOKEN
X-TOKEN is designed to be secure. As mentioned above, our token distribution is one of the healthiest ones currently available, with no whales controlling outlandish amounts of the circulating supply. In addition, the X-TOKEN smart contract has implemented two important security features, aimed at making the token fully autonomous and immune to malicious manipulation. Fraudulent blockchain-based schemes running on BSC are rife, and we take steps to ensure that X-TOKEN is as far from that space as possible.
